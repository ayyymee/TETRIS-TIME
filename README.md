#### Description:
  
Although I was never good at it, I always enjoyed playing tetris. Hence, I thought it would be a fun challenge to take bits and pieces of different languages I've learned to date. Here, I've created a basic version of tetris using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
  

For those who may not know, the objective of tetris is simple. You try to fill a full row with blocks that are coming down from the top of the screen. 

I consider this version of tetris simple for several resons:
1. There is minimal styling
2. There is minimal controls (only arrows up/down/left/right)
3. There is only one level
  

In this game of tetris, I was able to integrate the following JavaScript methods (in alphabetical order):
1. add()
2. addEventListener()
3. clearInterval()
4. contains()
5. every()
6. forEach()
7. innerHTML()
8. keyCode()
9. length
10. Math.floor()
11. Math.random()
12. querySelector()
13. querySelectorAll()
14. remove()
15. setInterval()
16. some()
17. splice()


If you'd like to play and you haven't played before, here are the following instructions:
1.  Press Start/Pause on the Left upper corner
2.  You can move the blocks around (left/right/up(rotates)/down(increase the speed of the downfall)).
3.  The blocks will fall at a constant rate but you have the capability to change them faster to optimize your blocks on the screen
