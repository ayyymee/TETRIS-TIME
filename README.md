#### Description:

---------- HOW IT STARTED ---------- 

CS50X is one of the introductory computer science courses I took this year. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the end of the course, students are asked to create a final project of their own. The autonomy this final project gives is very rewarding. I decided to code Tetris.

Although I was never good at it, I always enjoyed playing tetris. Hence, I thought it would be a fun challenge to take bits and pieces of different languages I've learned to date. Here, I've created a basic version of tetris using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
  
---------- OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME ---------- 

For those who may not know, the objective of tetris is simple. You try to fill a full row with tetrominoes that are coming down from the top of the screen. 

---------- HOW THIS GAME DIFFERS ---------- 

I consider this version of tetris simple for several resons:
1. There is minimal styling
2. There is minimal controls (only arrows up/down/left/right)
3. There is only one level
4. There is a constant rate at which the tetrominoes will be falling
  
----------  PERSONAL LEARNINGS ---------- 

I really enjoyed coding this game and was able to practice using the following JavaScript methods (in alphabetical order):
1. add()
2. addEventListener()
3. clearInterval()
4. contains()
5. every()
6. forEach()
7. innerHTML()
8. keyCode()
9. length
10. Math.floor()
11. Math.random()
12. querySelector()
13. querySelectorAll()
14. remove()
15. setInterval()
16. some()
17. splice()

---------- OPPORTUNITIES ---------- 

In the future, I would love to be able to create an advanced iteration of this game by: 
1. Include a variety of levels that increase with difficulty
2. Include music
3. Include other controls in the game on the keyboard including the "space bar" for an efficient droop of the tetrominoe and "ESC" to start/pause the game. 

---------- THE GAME ----------  

When you start the game, you will immediately notice the title "Tetris Time" with a scoreboard right below it. The scoreboard will keep track of how many times you are able to form a full row of tetrominoes. Each new row of tetrominoes you are able to create will grant you +10 points. The game ends when you reach the top of the game board with any one of the tetrominoes. 


---------- HOW TO PLAY ---------- 

If you'd like to play and you haven't played before, here are the following instructions:
1.  Press Start/Pause on the Left upper corner
2.  You can move the blocks around (left/right/up(rotates)/down(increase the speed of the downfall)).
3.  The tetrominoes will fall at a constant rate but you have the capability to change them faster to optimize your blocks on the screen

Good luck!

---------- THE END ---------- 
I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I had fun creating it.
